## Frontend Mentor Challenge 15 - Blog Preview Card

This is my solution to the [Blog Preview Card](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01IcS) challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

#

### Links. üîó

- Live Site URL: https://blog-preview-card-darkstarxdd.vercel.app/

#

### Built with. üî®

- HTML.
- Tailwind.
- Vite.

#

### Features. ‚ú®

- The requirements of the project stated that the font sizes need to slightly change with the screen size, but without using media queries. So I used the `clamp()` function on the font size.
  ```css
  .text-clamp-100 {
    font-size: clamp(0.75rem, 2vw, 0.875rem);
  }
  ```

#

### Testing and Accessibility. üß™

- Used the Responsively App to check how the site looks on various screen sizes, starting from 320 x 480 and going up to 3000 x 2000.
- Using Firefox on desktop, changed the browser font size to extreme low and high values (9px to 56px respectively).
- Zoom the page in and out using Ctrl + Scroll wheel.
- Tested using NVDA screen reader.
- Viewed the site on an iPhone 11.
- Performed Lighthouse and PageSpeed tests. ([PageSpeed Result.](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-workit-landing-page-darkstarxdd-vercel-app/7ylu6a0i49?form_factor=mobile))

#

### New Things Learned. üéì

- Tailwind. It's my first time using Tailwind, so I had to learn how to setup a project with it. Had to search in the [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/) a bit to find some class names. The [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) VS Code plugin was super helpful since it shows the underlying CSS properties for each utility class.
- Also learned a bit about how to use `tailwind.config.js` file to extend the default theme to include my own custom values.
- Using `@layer` to include my own classes.

#

### Ending Notes. üìù

- I am not entirely sure how much I like using Tailwind yet. This was only a very small project. I still enjoy creating all my classes and variables from scratch. Maybe on bigger projects Tailwind shows it's true power.
